# Demeter Crawler

Demeter (greek olympean goddess of harvest) is a 
social media crawling project.

Its main purpose is the _harvesting_ of (social) multimedia related to a certain tag.

## Setup

This is a Java 8 project using Gradle.
Thus all dependencies are handled by the gradle buildfile
and the prerequisite is obviously a JDK 8.
Although this project is being developed with the Oracle JDK,
it might work with others as well.
